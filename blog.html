                <p>We are a small software and design firm located in Northern Virginia that specializes in Internet infrastructure. We live and breathe bits, nibbles and bytes. We eat RFCs for lunch. We understand that this stuff can be complicated so we focus on making simple, intuitive user interfaces for a positive experience.</p>
                <p>Our software powers the Internet, yet you've never heard of us. That's because we craft rock solid software that allows you to focus on your business and not worry about your network, even when your network is your business.</p>
                <p>We are passionate software professionals who are highly engaged with our clients to design, develop, test and document the best possible system.</p>

                <h4 class="subheader">What we do</h4>
                <p>We write software. Specifically, we write software for core Internet technologies like DNS and routing. We also write DevOps software for network monitoring and automation. But we do much more than that. We do analysis, gather requirements, architect solutions, design the user interface, write automated tests, write the code, document the entire system, automate deployment, and monitor the system. We save you money at the same time by achieving results much faster with a very small team. That is what our experience can do for you!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="twelve columns">
                <h4 class="subheader">How we work</h4>
                <p>We practice a lightweight, agile software development process. We provide a small team of 1 - 3 experts who work with you from gathering requirements through design, development, testing, documentation, deployment and monitoring of your solution. Sometimes we sit alongside our customers on a daily basis and other times we work from our office, but either way we are in constant communication because we work quickly and it requires you to steer the ship at a pace that is faster than you are accustomed to.</p>

        <p>Bryan founded Cobenian to help companies that are involved in the development and maintenance of critical Internet infrastructure. He has extensive experience writing software for and consulting to numerous clients from small VC funded start-ups to government agencies and large multi-national corporations. Most recently he spent four years as a consultant at the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) helping re-write many of their core systems related to provisioning, DNS, IRR and RPKI. When he is not pouring over RFCs, he enjoys studying programming languages and trying to keep up with his 2 young boys.</p>
