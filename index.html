            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Increasing Diversity in the Elixir Community</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">August 23, 2015 by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/brweber2">Bryan</a></p>

            <p>
              Are you interested in increasing the diversity in the young Elixir community?
              Are you willing to contribute to make it happen?
            </p>

            <p>
              We are teaching the second <b><a href="http://www.elixirmastery.com">Elixir Mastery</a></b> class on <b>November 4-6 in Washington, D.C.</b>
              For our first class we had a corporate sponsor pay for two scholarships.
              We wanted to double the number of scholarships for our second class.
            </p>

            <p>
              We have already given out four scholarships for the class and we have several people on the waiting list.
              Interest in the class has been high. We would like to make scholarships available to more people.
              We are now seeking additional corporate sponsors that will open doors for more women, minorities and people without the financial means to attend the class.

            </p>

            <br/>
            <h3>What does it cost?</h3>

            <p>
              Tuition for the class is $1000 per student.
              We are asking for $600 per student to cover the costs of the class.
              We will cover the remaining $400. If you are unable to contribute
              the full amount we can pool contributions together so no contribution
              is too small.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some students may require travel and lodging as well as tuition for
              the class. A sponsor may choose to additionally cover the cost of
              travel and lodging. We currently have one student on the waiting
              list from Portland.
            </p>

            <br/>
            <h3>What does the student get?</h3>

            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>3 days of professional training</li>
                <li>2 books on Elixir</li>
                <li>Breakfast, lunch and snacks</li>
                <li>Access to all the class materials</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <br/>
            <h3>What do you get?</h3>

            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>1 more member of the Elixir community</li>
                <li>Your logo on the Elixir Mastery website as a diversity sponsor</li>
                <li>2 tweets of gratitude for sponsoring a seat in the class</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <br/>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Handing over a self contained Elixir program</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">June 12, 2015 by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/brweber2">Bryan</a></p>

            <p>
              One of the reasons for the rapid adoption of the Go programming language
              is that it can be crossed compiled down to a set of architecture
              specific static binaries. The deployment model for these programs
              is often described as 'scp' because all it takes to distribute
              the progams in a runnable state is to copy a single file. Of course, this is sometimes an
              over simplification if there are config files, external dependencies (database anyone?),
              etc. but for many programs the deployment model really is that simple.
            </p>

            <p>
              Recently we wanted similar behavior for some internal development
              tools (<b><em>this blog focuses on CLI programs</em></b>) that we're writing at Cobenian in Elixir. With some help
              from one or two people on the #elixir-lang freenode channel we
              were able to get it working, so we thought it might be helpful to
              document for other folks in the community.
            </p>

            <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
            The goal of this blog post is to show you how you can enable other developers
            or sys admins to run command line tools on *nix systems without having

            You must build your release on a similar platform to where it will run.

            <h2>The Details</h2>


            <h3>Create a mix project</h3>
            <p>
              <pre><code class="elixir">
mix new cli_tool
              </code></pre>

              The output should look something like:
              <pre>
* creating README.md
* creating .gitignore
* creating mix.exs
* creating config
* creating config/config.exs
* creating lib
* creating lib/cli_tool.ex
* creating test
* creating test/test_helper.exs
* creating test/cli_tool_test.exs

Your mix project was created successfully.
You can use mix to compile it, test it, and more:

    cd cli_tool
    mix test

Run `mix help` for more commands.
              </pre>
              <a name="main_function">&nbsp;</a>
              <div>&nbsp;</div>
            </p>

            <h3>Write your code with a main/1 function</h3>
            <p>
              <div class="label label-default">
                lib/cli_tool.ex
              </div>
              <pre><code class="elixir">
defmodule CliTool do
  def main(args) do
    args |> Enum.map(&amp;print_arg/1)
  end

  def print_arg(arg) do
    IO.puts "arg: #{arg}"
  end
end
              </code></pre>

              Be sure to have 1 parameter in  your main function.

              <a name="exrm">&nbsp;</a>
              <div>&nbsp;</div>
            </p>

            <h3>Add exrm dependency</h3>
            <p>
              <div class="label label-default">
                mix.exs
              </div>
              <pre><code class="elixir">
defp deps do
  [{:exrm, "~> 0.17"},
   {:relx, github: "erlware/relx"}]
end
              </code></pre>

              <a name="deps">&nbsp;</a>
              <div>&nbsp;</div>
            </p>

            <h3>Get the dependencies</h3>
            <p>
              <pre><code class="elixir">
mix deps.get
              </code></pre>

              <a name="release">&nbsp;</a>
              <div>&nbsp;</div>
            </p>

            <h3>Build the release</h3>
            <p>
              <pre><code class="elixir">
mix release
              </code></pre>

              The release will be built under a directory called 'rel' within a
              sub-directory named after your project. The single artifact
              that we care about is the tar bundle in that sub-directory.

              In our case that is:

              <pre>
rel/cli_tool/cli_tool-0.0.1.tar.gz
              </pre>

              <a name="distribute">&nbsp;</a>
              <div>&nbsp;</div>
            </p>

            <h3>Distribute the release</h3>
            <p>
              There will be a gzip'd tar under rel/cli_tool/cli_tool-0.0.1.tar.gz.
              The directory name and file name will be different if you used
              a different project name and/or version.

              So let's pretend we want to scp the file to dev.example.com.

              <pre><code>
scp rel/cli_tool/cli_tool-0.0.1.tar.gz developer@dev.example.com:~/
              </code></pre>

              Now, log into that machine and prepare to run our code.

              <pre><code>
ssh developer@dev.example.com
dev.example.com$> mkdir cli_tool
dev.example.com$> cp cli_tool-0.0.1.tar.gz cli_tool/
dev.example.com$> cd cli_tool
dev.example.com$> tar xvfz cli_tool-0.0.1.tar.gz
              </code></pre>

              Note that the tar bundle does <b>NOT</b> include a single directory
              with everything in it. So you will probably want to create a new
              directory and untar the contents there like I did above.

              <a name="run">&nbsp;</a>
              <div>&nbsp;</div>
            </p>

            <h3>Run the release</h3>
            <p>
              If we were to manually run our code on the command line it would
              look like this:
            <pre><code>
bin/cli_tool escript lib/cli_tool-0.0.1/ebin/Elixir.CliTool.beam "foo" "bar"
            </code></pre>

            The output should look like this:
            <pre>
arg: foo
arg: bar
            </pre>
            <p>

            <br/><br/>
            <h3>Slightly Improved</h3>
            <p>

            That's not very user friendly, so let's improve it a tad.

            In your project root create a file called priv/cli_tool.sh.

            <br/>
            <div class="label label-default">
              priv/cli_tool.sh
            </div>
            <pre><code>
#!/bin/bash

DIR=$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )

cd $DIR
../../../bin/cli_tool escript lib/cli_tool-0.0.1/ebin/Elixir.CliTool.beam $@
            </code></pre>

            And don't forget to make your file executable.

            <pre><code>
chmod +x priv/cli_tool.sh
            </code></pre>

            Now you can rebuild your release and re-distribute it following the
            steps outlined above.

            Then you can run the bash script and pass it arguments:

            <pre><code>
lib/cli_tool-0.0.1/priv/cli_tool.sh ARGS GO HERE
            </code></pre>

            At this point, you'll most likely want to put lib/cli_tool-0.0.1/priv
            in your path.

            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <h3>Cleaning Up</h3>
            <p>
              If you need to clean out a previous release you built you can use
              the following command prior to running 'mix release' again.

              <pre><code>
mix release.clean --implode
              </code></pre>
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <h3>Conclusion and Feedback</h3>
            <p>
              So this is admittedly not as convenient as having a single, static
              binary like you get with Go. I'm also not aware of a way to cross
              compile Elixir releases right now.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, this isn't too bad if your team uses Macs or Linux. You
              simply distribute a tarball to your team members, they untar it
              and add a directory to their path.
            </p>

            <p>
              So while this isn't perfect, it certainly is acceptable for our team
              given that it means we get to write more tools in Elixir.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, I suspect that the Elixir community will have plenty to
              say about this process and hopefully they can make some
              suggestions of ways to improve it.
            </p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Why is Elixir pattern matching special?</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">June 10, 2015 by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/brweber2">Bryan</a></p>

            <p>
            Perhaps by now you've heard that Elixir is the next big thing? Or maybe you think it is just the latest fad,
            but either way it has some truly interesting features that will be new to you if you've only ever done
            Object Oriented Programming (or only programmed in Java, Ruby, C#, Python, PHP, and JavaScript).
            </p>

            <p>
              Years ago I had a conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/jsuereth">Josh Suereth</a>
              at a conference and we compared pattern matching in Scala and Erlang.
              It was a really fun conversation and in it I made the assertion that
              Erlang's pattern matching was more powerful than Scala's. Josh asked
              how that could be given that Scala provides an API that enables
              the developer to determine what the match behavior should be!
              I frankly was unable to explain it at the time which to me was a
              sign that while I was perhaps on to something, <b><em>I didn't yet understand
              it well enough to articulate it</em></b>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Many years have passed and in the last several months I have taken
              a deep dive into Elixir because of my previous interest in Erlang.
              I also took some time to study Prolog since that conversation
              and now I finally feel like I can explain why pattern matching is so
              powerful and this blog post attempts to express my thoughts. This
              post is starting to get a little long, so I've left out a <i>ton</i>
              of details at every turn, but I tried to hit on the major points here.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <h2>By the power of Prolog...</h2>

            <p>
              The early implementations of Erlang were written in Prolog, so
              some uses of Prolog semantics shine through in Erlang and Elixir
              to this day.  Pattern matching is one such case.
            </p>

            <p>
              In order to begin to appreciate pattern matching you have to understand
              what it has to offer and what it is good for.  Pattern matching in
              Erlang and Elixir is more than the de-structuring you'll find in
              other programming languages like Scala and Clojure.
            </p>

            <br/>
            <h3>Some uses of pattern matching</h3>

              <li>assertions</li>

              <li>smarter case statements</li>
              <li>removing conditionals</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So let's look at each one in turn before we try to draw some
              conclusions based on the big picture.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <h3>The "how can I make this true?" operator...</h3>
            <h4>a.k.a. "assignment"</h4>
            <p>
              We recently taught a two day Elixir class at Living Social in Washington D.C.
              (Don't worry, we're going to offer it again this fall if you missed it! Follow
              <a href="https://twitter.com/elixirmastery">Elixir Mastery</a> to learn more when we finalize the details
              over the next few weeks.)
              One of the first things we covered is that '=' appears to work
              just like assignment in other programming languages, but upon closer
              inspection it is not at all the same.
            </p>

            <p>
              In Elixir the '=' operator does <b>NOT</b> assign the value on the right
              hand side to the variable on the left hand side.  Instead it attempts
              to unify the left hand side and right hand side into a statement that
              is true. This means that

              <pre><code class="elixir">
x = 3
              </code></pre>

              should not be read as "set the value of x to 3" but instead you can think of it
              as "how can I make this statement true?"  Well, one way to that this
              statement can be true is if x has the value 3. So let's set the
              value to 3.
            </p>

            <p>
              At first glance, this appears to be a useless parlor trick and of
              no real significance, but let's dig in a little deeper now.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <h3>assertions</h3>

            <p>
              One thing that many developers new to Elixir find odd is that the
              following code works.

              <pre><code class="elixir">
3 = x
              </code></pre>

              If you've only ever worked with the likes of Java, Ruby or JavaScript
              then this may seem odd to you.  However, if you remember what the '='
              operator means, you'll see that as long as the value of x is 3
              then this statement will be true.
            </p>

            <p>
              So what exactly happens when the value of x is not 3?  The TL;DR
              version is that a MatchError is thrown.  That means that I can use
              this pattern to assert certain expected states in my program. Concise,
              but is it really that much better than an explicit call to 'assert'
              in a program?  I think that it would be hard to argue that case
              convincingly. So this is nice, but let's keep moving through
              the various uses of pattern matching.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <h3>de-structuring</h3>

            <p>
              De-structuring allows a developer to rip apart data structures
              and set the value of many variables at once.

              <pre><code class="elixir">
{first_name, last_name} = {"John", "Doe"}
              </code></pre>

              Again, using our "how can this statement be made true?" logic,
              we can see that if the variable 'first_name' had the value "John"
              and the variable 'last_name' had the value "Doe" then this
              statement would be true. So that's exactly what Elixir does.
            </p>

            <p>
              De-structuring is very useful for two reasons in my opinion.
              The first is because it allows the developer to do several
              important things in one concise step, namely dig into the parts of the data structure that we
              care about.  But secondly, and every bit as
              importantly, we as people have a <b>very</b> easy time understanding
              de-structuring on an intuitive level. Typically doing several things
              (like setting the values of multiple variables) in one step in
              code would be confusing and tough to reason about when a bug arose.
              However, with de-structruing that is often not the case because
              our brains are good at recognizing patterns and we can see the
              symmetry between the left hand side and right hand side.
            </p>

            <p>
              Also really helpful is that we can do destructuring on function
              parameters.

              <pre><code class="elixir">
def greet({first_name, last_name}) do
  IO.puts "Hello #{first_name} #{last_name}, how are you?"
end
              </code></pre>

              In fact, we can nest pattern matches here and we can even do this
              convenient match as well:

              <pre><code class="elixir">
def greet(person={first_name, last_name}) do
  IO.puts "Hello #{first_name} #{last_name}, how are you?"
  Email.send_to(person)
end
              </code></pre>

              Notice that in addition to the de-structuring of the tuple itself,
              we've also used pattern matching a second time to assign the value of the
              entire tuple itself to the variable 'person'.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <h3>smarter case statements</h3>

            <p>
              In some languages (Java in particular) you are limited in what
              you can match on in case statements. Elixir gives you full
              pattern matching for case statements:

              <pre><code class="elixir">
case user do
  {first_name, nil} -> IO.puts "Last name is required."
  {nil, last_name} -> IO.puts "First name is required."
  u -> IO.puts "Hello #{elem(u, 1)}"
end
              </code></pre>
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <h3>removing conditionals</h3>

            <p>
              Imagine that you have a function that is responsible for adding
              three integers in a tuple. Easy, right?

              <pre><code class="elixir">
def triple_adder({a, b, c}) do
  a + b + c
end
              </code></pre>

              But what if you also wanted to be able to accept a list of three
              numbers and add them as well? We might end up with something like this:

              <pre><code class="elixir">
def triple_adder(list_or_struct) do
  if is_list(list_or_struct) do
    [a, b, c] = list_or_struct
    a + b + c
  else
    {a, b, c} = list_or_struct
    a + b + c
  end
end
              </code></pre>

              Sure, this is a contrived example, but sometimes the number of
              nested if's becomes quite complex and we end up with messy code.
            </p>

            <p>
              Elixir identifies functions by module, name and arity (just a fancy
              word for the number of parameters), but you can define a function
              in multiple pieces and the first one that matches is the one
              that will be executed. Therefore, we can simplify the code we
              just wrote and remove the conditional completely.

              <pre><code class="elixir">
def triple_adder({a, b, c}) do
  a + b + c
end

def triple_adder([a, b, c]) do
  a + b + c
end
              </code></pre>

              Now when we call triple_adder the decision on which block will
              execute will depend on the arguments. Again, this example is
              very simple, but in real code this pattern removes a remarkable
              number of conditionals from your code and leaves very short,
              concise and readable functions in their place.
            </p>

            <p>
              This function dispatching based on pattern matching is what makes
              pattern matching in Elixir feel magical in my opinion and what
              puts it ahead of simple de-structuring.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some people will argue that this form of function dispatch is actually
              a code smell and that all dispatching should be encapsulated in
              types. Pattern matching can look like a glorified case statement
              at times which would mean that every time a new type was added
              old code would have to be re-written to account for the new type(s).
              And in object oriented code that is the case.  However, in Elixir
              we don't define new classes as types, the set of types is fixed
              to what the language provides for us. Abusing structs is one case where
              this problem can arise in Elixir, but for the vast majority of cases
              you will simply describe the data structures you have and how
              you will handle them. In other words, you care about the structure
              of your data and not the type.
            </p>

            <p>
              One final point is that this form of pattern matching changes the
              locality of the business logic in your code. With encapsulation the
              logic is spread out across your different type implementations (classes).
              However, with pattern matching your logic tends to centralize
              in the same place, where the matches occur. Depending on the
              complexity of your code and your personal stylistic preferences,
              you may legitimately want to have the logic in one place or spread
              across multiple places in your code base. So I don't chalk this up
              as a pro or a con, but rather a more nuanced 'it depends' type
              of situation. Not to mention that you can use structs and protocols
              in Elixir to get OOP like behavior when appropriate.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <h2>The end of this long blog post</h2>

            <p>
              In my opinion it is this final case and the fact that pattern matching
              is pervasive that sets pattern matching in Elixir
              apart from other languages. The code I write in Elixir naturally
              has much shorter functions and far fewer conditionals than in any
              other programming language I've used.
            </p>

            <p>
              Pattern matching in Elixir is powerful and interesting. I sometimes
              use the analogy that pattern matching is sort of like having an AI that just knows how to do certain
              things with your code that you don't want to have to take the time
              to describe, but that you intuitively just know. Sort of like those
              students who know the right answers on their math test, but who
              can't explain exactly how or why they know the answer is correct.
              Pattern matching is one of my all time favorite uses of Prolog,
              it uses logic programming to help make your programming simpler!

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Introducing demoit.io</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">April 14, 2015 by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/brweber2">Bryan</a></p>

            <p>
              We're proud to introduce <a href="https://www.demoit.io">demoit.io</a>, the simplest way to share your web design work
              with your clients.  demoit.io is a product that came from our desire to have a
              tool that allowed us to share new website designs with clients as we iterated
              over various versions, incorporating feedback along the way.
             </p>

             <h3>TL;DR</h3>
             <blockquote>
               It allows you to iterate over HTML designs with your client. It is
               easy for you and even easier for your client. It is like having
               version control as you get feedback from your clients.
             </blockquote>


             <h3>The Problem</h3>
             <p>
               We started by
               sharing our work over email. It worked, but it didn't work well. Feedback was
                spread out of dozens of emails, clients confused versions and we couldn't tell who
                had actually taken the time to look at our work.
               We realized that we needed something better. We went looking for something
               that would solve our problem.  An open source project, a software as a service
               product, anything really. We were surprised that we couldn't find what we were looking
               for, so we decided to build something for ourselves.
             </p>

             <h3>The first attempt</h3>
             <p>
               We stood up our own nginx server. We had to make sure that the
               work we did for clients was kept private,
               so we turned on authentication. This worked
               for a little while, but every time the client requested that someone else be
               included or removed we had to make changes to our configuration. We had to keep
               our work separated by client because we certainly
               didn't want to accidentally share work for one client with another client.
               We still had to put together a distribution list and send emails to let clients know when a new
               version was available. Clients couldn't keep track of their passwords so we
               were constantly resetting them. In a lot of ways, it was a step back from email
               because the administrative burden put on us was higher and clients had to ask
               us to reset their password before they could see the new version.
             </p>

             <h3>Ah ha moment</h3>
             <p>
               Finally, after an internal brainstorming session, we realized that we could fix
               this problem and that it would be useful for other companies as well. Web
               designers, web developers, even teams within large companies could benefit
               from a tool that allowed web designers to distribute their work privately
               to their clients.
             </p>

             <h3>Guiding Principles</h3>
             <p>
               We decided to set a few guiding principles during our architecture design phase.
               First, the tool must make it easy for our clients to use. Not just easy, but beyond easy. No more
               passwords for them to remember, no unzipping files and having to figure out
               what to do with the contents, no more confusion about which version was the
               newest.
             </p>

             <h3>Beyond Easy</h3>
             <p>
               In demoit.io clients receive an email when you notify them that a new version
               is available and they click on a link to see your latest work.
               They have nothing else to do.
             </p>

             <h3>Security</h3>
             <blockquote>
               We needed it to be private, but as soon as we added passwords our clients
               couldn't ever seem to remember them.
             </blockquote>
             <p>
               How is a link secure? We generate
               a unique access key for every client for every notification they are sent.
               This
               access key + HTTPS is what allows us to know whether or not the client can be trusted
               and what content the client should see.
             </p>

             <h3>Content Generation</h3>
             <blockquote>
               We decided very early on that designers and web developers want to use their own
               tools. We don't force you to try to use demoit.io to generate your work, we just
               help you get it to your clients.
             </blockquote>
             <!-- <p>
               So far, so good, but what about from the web designer's point of view? Here we
               made a critical decision, that we are not going to try to mandate how our
               clients generate their content. Do you use photoshop to design screens?  A text
               editor and you sling HTML and CSS in your first go round? Do you draw on paper
               with a pencil?  Why should we mandate how you do your work?  We shouldn't. So
               demoit.io always allows you to use your current tools to generate content.
             </p> -->

             <p>
               Now you have your content, so what's next?  Well, we thought about lots of
               different ways that you could get it in front of your clients.
               <!-- A desktop tool that sucks up your files and magically makes them get to where
               they need to go? We aren't convinced that most users want to install a native
               tool just for uploading files when the browser can already do it.  -->
               In the end we decided
               to have users zip up their content and upload it.
               <!-- So now users have a way to
               get their content uploaded to demoit.io so it can be shared with their clients. -->
               But when it is time to share your work with the client, what exactly will the client see?
               <!-- How will they know where to start?  -->
               Just like programming languages have a "main"
               method the web has "index.html" as its starting point. So the one requirement
               we place upon uploaded content is that it contains a index.html file.
              <!-- so users that view the content have a place to start. -->
             </p>

             <h3>zip, click, demoed</h3>
             <p>
               Now you probably see why we say, "zip, click, demoed."  Web designers zip up their
               content, click a button to upload it and click another button to notify their
               clients. The client clicks a link and the work is demoed.
               Ok, so technically that's zip, click, click, click, demoed, but that just
               doesn't have quite the same ring to it, does it now?
             </p>

             <p>
               One of the questions we are asked the most often is why we don't offer a free
               plan?  "Haven't you ever read the software as a service rules?"  "Don't you
               know your conversion rates will be much higher?"  Of course, we're aware that
               most software services offer a free plan these days, but for every rule there
               is an exception. In our case, the exceptional case is security. demoit.io
               could be abused by spammers and folks who want to distribute malware via
               malicious sites. We certainly don't want to enable these people or be associated
               with such activity. So we've decided that we will only support paid plans and
               we've tried to set the price point such that it disincentivizes anyone who
               would try to abuse our system in such ways.
             </p>

             <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
             <p>
               All the geeks out there want to know what we used to build demoit.io.
               So here it is in all its glory.
             </p>
             <ul>
               <li><a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a></li>
               <li><a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org">Phoenix</a></li>
               <li><a href="http://emberjs.com">Ember</a></li>
               <li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a></li>
               <li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a></li>
               <li><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">Postgresql</a></li>

               <li><a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a></li>
             </ul>
             <p>
               <!-- So what about the technology stack? Are we a buzzword compliant alphabet soup
               of the latest and greatest technologies?  Actually, yes and no.   -->
               We use Ember.js
               and Ember data to have a fast web application that consumes data via RESTful
               services.
               If you've ever heard of Twitter Bootstrap you can probably tell
               that we use it as well.  For our backend, we use Phoenix, a web framework
               written in Elixir. We're huge fans of Elixir and the Erlang ecosystem that it
               is built on. In fact, we run our local Elixir meetup. We use Postgres for the
               database and we're deployed on AWS. Was it a fun tech stack to work with? You'd
                better believe it! Ember had a learning curve and it took the most effort
               to become proficient in, but you'd be hard pressed to find a better stack
               in 2015.
            </p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
               So there you have it.  Why we decided to build demoit.io, some of the design
               decisions we made along the way and some high level information about our
               tech stack. We hope you'll check us out at <a href="https://www.demoit.io">www.demoit.io</a>!

They have some particularly nice comments about how easy the system is to use. It warms our hearts to see that our hard work, as part of the team that implemented RPKI at ARIN, was recognized by someone as easy to use because we spent a lot of time trying to make a very complex system usable. We recently updated our documentation on RPKI & BGPSec so be sure to check it out!
