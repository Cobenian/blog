            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Introducing demoit.io</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">April 14, 2015 by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/brweber2">Bryan</a></p>

            <p>
              We're proud to introduce <a href="https://www.demoit.io">demoit.io</a>, the simplest way to share your web design work
              with your clients.  demoit.io is a product that came from our desire to have a
              tool that allowed us to share new website designs with clients as we iterated
              over various versions, incorporating feedback along the way.
             </p>

             <h3>TL;DR</h3>
             <blockquote>
               It allows you to iterate over HTML designs with your client. It is
               easy for you and even easier for your client. It is like having
               version control as you get feedback from your clients.
             </blockquote>


             <h3>The Problem</h3>
             <p>
               We started by
               sharing our work over email. It worked, but it didn't work well. Feedback was
                spread out of dozens of emails, clients confused versions and we couldn't tell who
                had actually taken the time to look at our work.
               We realized that we needed something better. We went looking for something
               that would solve our problem.  An open source project, a software as a service
               product, anything really. We were surprised that we couldn't find what we were looking
               for, so we decided to build something for ourselves.
             </p>

             <h3>The first attempt</h3>
             <p>
               We stood up our own nginx server. We had to make sure that the
               work we did for clients was kept private,
               so we turned on authentication. This worked
               for a little while, but every time the client requested that someone else be
               included or removed we had to make changes to our configuration. We had to keep
               our work separated by client because we certainly
               didn't want to accidentally share work for one client with another client.
               We still had to put together a distribution list and send emails to let clients know when a new
               version was available. Clients couldn't keep track of their passwords so we
               were constantly resetting them. In a lot of ways, it was a step back from email
               because the administrative burden put on us was higher and clients had to ask
               us to reset their password before they could see the new version.
             </p>

             <h3>Ah ha moment</h3>
             <p>
               Finally, after an internal brainstorming session, we realized that we could fix
               this problem and that it would be useful for other companies as well. Web
               designers, web developers, even teams within large companies could benefit
               from a tool that allowed web designers to distribute their work privately
               to their clients.
             </p>

             <h3>Guiding Principles</h3>
             <p>
               We decided to set a few guiding principles during our architecture design phase.
               First, the tool must make it easy for our clients to use. Not just easy, but beyond easy. No more
               passwords for them to remember, no unzipping files and having to figure out
               what to do with the contents, no more confusion about which version was the
               newest.
             </p>

             <h3>Beyond Easy</h3>
             <p>
               In demoit.io clients receive an email when you notify them that a new version
               is available and they click on a link to see your latest work.
               They have nothing else to do.
             </p>

             <h3>Security</h3>
             <blockquote>
               We needed it to be private, but as soon as we added passwords our clients
               couldn't ever seem to remember them.
             </blockquote>
             <p>
               How is a link secure? We generate
               a unique access key for every client for every notification they are sent.
               This
               access key + HTTPS is what allows us to know whether or not the client can be trusted
               and what content the client should see.
             </p>

             <h3>Content Generation</h3>
             <blockquote>
               We decided very early on that designers and web developers want to use their own
               tools. We don't force you to try to use demoit.io to generate your work, we just
               help you get it to your clients.
             </blockquote>
             <!-- <p>
               So far, so good, but what about from the web designer's point of view? Here we
               made a critical decision, that we are not going to try to mandate how our
               clients generate their content. Do you use photoshop to design screens?  A text
               editor and you sling HTML and CSS in your first go round? Do you draw on paper
               with a pencil?  Why should we mandate how you do your work?  We shouldn't. So
               demoit.io always allows you to use your current tools to generate content.
             </p> -->

             <p>
               Now you have your content, so what's next?  Well, we thought about lots of
               different ways that you could get it in front of your clients.
               <!-- A desktop tool that sucks up your files and magically makes them get to where
               they need to go? We aren't convinced that most users want to install a native
               tool just for uploading files when the browser can already do it.  -->
               In the end we decided
               to have users zip up their content and upload it.
               <!-- So now users have a way to
               get their content uploaded to demoit.io so it can be shared with their clients. -->
               But when it is time to share your work with the client, what exactly will the client see?
               <!-- How will they know where to start?  -->
               Just like programming languages have a "main"
               method the web has "index.html" as its starting point. So the one requirement
               we place upon uploaded content is that it contains a index.html file.
              <!-- so users that view the content have a place to start. -->
             </p>

             <h3>zip, click, demoed</h3>
             <p>
               Now you probably see why we say, "zip, click, demoed."  Web designers zip up their
               content, click a button to upload it and click another button to notify their
               clients. The client clicks a link and the work is demoed.
               Ok, so technically that's zip, click, click, click, demoed, but that just
               doesn't have quite the same ring to it, does it now?
             </p>

             <p>
               One of the questions we are asked the most often is why we don't offer a free
               plan?  "Haven't you ever read the software as a service rules?"  "Don't you
               know your conversion rates will be much higher?"  Of course, we're aware that
               most software services offer a free plan these days, but for every rule there
               is an exception. In our case, the exceptional case is security. demoit.io
               could be abused by spammers and folks who want to distribute malware via
               malicious sites. We certainly don't want to enable these people or be associated
               with such activity. So we've decided that we will only support paid plans and
               we've tried to set the price point such that it disincentivizes anyone who
               would try to abuse our system in such ways.
             </p>

             <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
             <p>
               All the geeks out there want to know what we used to build demoit.io.
               So here it is in all its glory.
             </p>
             <ul>
               <li><a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a></li>
               <li><a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org">Phoenix</a></li>
               <li><a href="http://emberjs.com">Ember</a></li>

               <li><a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a></li>
             </ul>
             <p>
               <!-- So what about the technology stack? Are we a buzzword compliant alphabet soup
               of the latest and greatest technologies?  Actually, yes and no.   -->
               We use Ember.js
               and Ember data to have a fast web application that consumes data via RESTful
               services.
               If you've ever heard of Twitter Bootstrap you can probably tell
               that we use it as well.  For our backend, we use Phoenix, a web framework
               written in Elixir. We're huge fans of Elixir and the Erlang ecosystem that it
               is built on. In fact, we run our local Elixir meetup. We use Postgres for the
               database and we're deployed on AWS. Was it a fun tech stack to work with? You'd
                better believe it! Ember had a learning curve and it took the most effort
               to become proficient in, but you'd be hard pressed to find a better stack
               in 2015.
            </p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
               So there you have it.  Why we decided to build demoit.io, some of the design
               decisions we made along the way and some high level information about our
               tech stack. We hope you'll check us out at <a href="https://www.demoit.io">www.demoit.io</a>!
